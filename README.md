# Lumos-App
A simple flashlight app I originally made in 2017 but updated in 2018.
It is Harry Potter themed (ergo the use of "lumos" to light up the tip of the wand.) 
This image corresponds with the flashlight turning on. 
New update from 2017 converts old API "camera" to "camera2". 
See comments in MainActivity.java for more information.
